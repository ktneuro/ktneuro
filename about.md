# About Me 
I am an extremely hard-working sophomore neuroscience student at UC Berkeley with a strong drive to become a computational neuroscientist. 

Growing up, I often watched my mother's struggle with mental health due to her Rheumatoid Arthritis. This instilled in me, a very deep curiousity for the physical processes of mental illness on the brain. I found myself fascinated by the way mental illness could change an individual's reality, their psyche overtaken by a disorder's seemingly mind-gripping effects. What I felt was so confusing about my mother, became something I could finally put into words with psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Ever since this point, I have made my education a strict priority, focusing my academic attention to neuroscience, bioengineering, and psychology. With my love for computers and technology, computational neuroscience fell into my lap, becoming a key aspect of neuroscience that intrigues me. Ultimately, using my education and passions as the foundations of the life I wish to build for myself. 

Outside of school, I am passionate about animals, espeically bears and cats. My favorite past times include, playing video games, drawing whatever my heart's desire, or baking a yummy treat for my family to share. All in all, I hope to combine my interests in neuroscience research with the broader scope of activism, using it as a piece of the catalyst for change. 

# Short-Term Goals
- Get involved with more research at UC Berkeley & other labs
- Balance all of my coursework, research, and extracurricular initatives efficiently
- Expand skills in programming and data analysis for computational neuroscience

# Long-Term Goals (for now)
- Attend graduate school and get way more into independent research
- Pursue a PhD in neuroscience, with some sort of focus on brain-machine interfaces, computational modeling, etc.
- Working towards finding my ultimate future long-term career in neuroscience

I created this website to showcase my projects, trials with coding, research experience, and outreach work. Thank you for reading.
