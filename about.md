# About Me 
I am a sophomore neuroscience student at UC Berkeley working towards a career in brain research. My interests include:

- Computational neuroscience  
- Neural signal decoding  
- Brain-machine interfaces  
- Psychology, biology, & software  
- Activism/expanding outreach

I created this website to showcase my projects, trials with coding, research experience, and outreach work.
