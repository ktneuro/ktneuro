# About Me 
I am an extremely hard-working sophomore neuroscience student at UC Berkeley with a strong drive to become a computational neuroscientist. 

Growing up, I often watched my mother's struggle with mental health due to her Rheumatoid Arthritis. This instilled in me, a very deep curiousity for the physical processes of mental illness on the brain. I found myself fascinated by the way mental illness could change an individual's reality, their psyche overtaken by a disorder's seemingly mind-gripping effects. What I felt was so confusing about my mother, became something I could finally put into words with psychology and neuroscience.




I am a sophomore neuroscience student at UC Berkeley working towards a career in brain research. My interests include:

- Computational neuroscience  
- Neural signal decoding  
- Brain-machine interfaces  
- Psychology, biology, & software  
- Activism/expanding outreach

I created this website to showcase my projects, trials with coding, research experience, and outreach work.
